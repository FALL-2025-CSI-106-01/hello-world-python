# Hi, this is a simple python program to get you started
# All lines that begin with a "#" are comments (not executed)

# The line shown below is a python instruction that will be executed
print()

# Strings are bits of text that the computer does not execute. 
# By themselves strings don't do much. 
"Hello World"

# When added to a "print" you can print them. Put "Hello World" into the print() 
# function.
